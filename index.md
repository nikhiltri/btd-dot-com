> BTD stands for Battle to Death

BTD is about dinosaurs and it's kind of like Jurassic Park.

## Some behind the scenes on BTD

I'm gonna gently slap my bedroom doorknob to record footstep sounds.

I'm taking pictures from the Jurassic World Facts app that look fiction-like to turn into non-fiction looking pictures for the movie.

I'm gonna make some of the dinosaur sounds cause I have great imitations.

I'm also drawing some of the dinosaurs with pens and pencils and crayons.

Now you know some things about behind-the-scenes Battle to Death! I think it's going to look really cool.

## Battle to Death dinosaurs

* Ceolophysis.Â It is a small dinosaur.
* Black Stripe. It is a velociraptor trained just like Blue. But it looks very different from Blue. And there's one scene that everyone will know around the world, I think, when Black Stripe and the Attack Pack (which is the pack that Black Stripe's in) attack the monstorous raptor, which is a hybrid.
* Da, da, daaaa... THE GIGONOTOSAURUS! It is gonna be one of the coolest dinosaurs in the movie. It's very colorful. It is one of the biggest dinosaurs in the movie, but not _the_ biggest. Another really cool scene is where the gigonotosaurs fights the t. rex.
* Daa, daa, DAAAAAA! THE MONSTOROUS RAPTOR!! It's made of scorpious rex from Camp Cretaceous, and indominous rex _and_ indoraptor! Oh no! And a t. rex and velociraptor. That's scary!
* Mosasaurus. It is an ocean reptile that in one scene jumps up and tries to bite Black Stripe! But Black Stripe dodges the bite and runs away with the Attack Pack.
* Oh my gosh I can't believe it. Da, da, daa... THE TYRANOSAURUS REX! In the movie it is feathered. It battles with the gigonotosaurs like I said in the gigonotosaurus one. In the movie it tries to eat John. And now onto a new dinosaur.
* Oh my, I can't believe we haven't done this yet. GASTONIA! When it swings its tail its spike cross in the movie which is true. It is about the size of a human.
* GARTER! It is a carnotaurus trained just like Blue, too. As a baby two t. rexes try to eat it. It help Black Stripe and the Attack Pack fight off the monstorous raptor. And he is bigger than a human. A LOT bigger. It's smaller than a t. rex and gigonotosaurus.

## Different parts of the movie

I am not going to mention ones we've already talked about.

A quetzalcoatlus is flying while a hetzogoopteryx flies below and they start fighting in the air!

The mosasaurus is swimming then another mosasaurus comes and soon he's in a pack of other mosasauruses that are racing to catch an elasmosaurus and plesiosaurus.

A t. rex is walking and suddenly from the sky four huge hekzagoopteryx dive down and pick up him off the ground.

A maiasaurura is walking and feeding its babies. And then the last egg hatches and she realized a triceratops has laid an egg in her nest by mistake.

A lailinasaura is walking and then a ceratosaurus starts chasing in. More lailinasaura join in so it's a pack of lailinasaura running away from a ceratosaurus.

A parasauralophus sees a majengasaurus and honks its crest to warn the herd.

And now for a new category!

## Music

This song is when Black Stripe first hatches.

This is when the t. rex and gigonotosaur fight!

This is the theme song. I wrote it on the piano and I changed it up like ten or eleven times.

This is the song when the parasaurolphus warns the heard that a majengosaurus is near.

## Visual effects

So, we're going to make _some_ on the computer. Some that are gonna be animatronic. Animatronic is you make a model of something and it has these gears to make it move and roar and other stuff. And some of it I'm just going to make by using my toys because I painted a lot of my toys after Battle to Death dinosaurs. And some we're going to make small models and paint it to look like what we want and then we're going to make the movie.

## Sound effects

Some we're going to record from me turning gears or doing something. Others we're gonna make with me roaring or doing my special effects from my voice. And some we're going to make on the computer. Some we're gonna make lower or slower or higher or faster.

For the one where the mosaurus is chasing the plesiosaurus and the elsamosaurus which I talked about, I'm gonna splash water in either my bathtub or a sink or something. I'm gonna record sound effect from my app that they made on the laptop.

## The sssstooooooryyyy

It starts off with some people arriving at the island, including John. They have a mission to help the people manage the island. When they get there gallimimus are everywhere. They are very surprised to see all of it. It's not normal to see all these dinosaurs and pterosaurs. A stegosaurus is wathcing and grazing nearby. They see two tricerotops horn-battling each other. They see an ankylosaurus fighting a t. rex.

Later on, the people give one person one egg and the other person five eggs. They think they should have dinosaurs that will help them. One hatches and that one is a carnotaurus, so that one egg is a carnotaurus egg. Then next five eggs start hatching and when John sees the velocipraptors inside he immediately has names for all of them. The one in the front is Black Stripe because he is all red on his back with black stripes. The one and the end is Blue Water, the all red one is Red Dasher, and the green and white one is Green Grass. Then the next one hatched and it was hard giving it a name. But they named it White Snow.

Suddenly a t. rex came! They all put their eggs and babies inside the building. And then ran. The t. rex started chasing John. That's not the whole movie but that's all I'm gonna say about it.

I think this website is very cool.
